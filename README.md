The deep learning model, known as GAN, or "Generative Adversarial Network," is made to produce new data that is similar to training data. A generator network that produces fresh and new data samples and a discriminator network that determines the veracity of these samples make up the two neural networks that make up the model. Although the discriminator attempts to accurately determine whether a sample is real or fake, the generator attempts to produce samples that can trick the discriminator into believing they are real. The two networks are simultaneously trained using a minimax game until the generator generates samples that are somewhat close to the real data. There are several uses for GANs, including picture synthesis, data augmentation, and style transfer.
